Minimum “instructor-created” GitHub items for Module 3

A predictable PR practice file (so everyone edits the same safe target)

Example: module-3/pr-practice.md

Students each add a short response in their own section.

This guarantees PR diffs are understandable and avoids random file edits.

Turn order post (so PRs don’t collide)
Pick one location:

Pinned GitHub Discussion comment (“Turn Order for Module 3”), or

A pinned Issue titled: Module 3 — Turn Order (PR + Reviews)

It should explicitly map:

“When you open PR” + “Who reviews you”

Enable Discussions + create a category (if you’re hosting the discussion in GitHub)

Category: Module Discussions

Then post and pin the instructor starter prompt.

That’s the bare minimum.

Strongly recommended (takes 5 minutes, pays off all term)

PR template (.github/pull_request_template.md)

Forces students to write a usable PR description.

Makes reviews dramatically better.

Code review checklist (CODE_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md)

Gives students a structure so reviews are not fluff.

These two become “training wheels” for the rest of the course.

Optional (only if you want stricter enforcement)

Branch protection settings tuned for the class

Require PRs to merge

Block direct pushes to main

Optionally require 1 approval

Optionally require “conversation resolved” before merge
