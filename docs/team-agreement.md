# Team Agreement — CSC-154

This document outlines how our team will work together. All team members should review and sign off on this agreement.

---

## Communication Norms

- **Primary channel:** GitHub Issues and PR comments (asynchronous)
- **Secondary channel:** [Slack / Discord / Email] for urgent questions
- **Response time:** Best effort within 24 hours for issues; 48 hours for non-urgent messages
- **Meeting cadence:** [Weekly standup on Tuesdays at 2 PM] (optional; adjust as needed)
- **Tone:** Professional, respectful, and kind — assume good intent

---

## Branch & PR Expectations

- All work happens on feature/fix branches; never commit directly to `main`
- Branch names follow the format: `feature-issue-123-name` or `fix-issue-456-name`
- PRs must:
  - Include a clear summary of changes
  - Link to the issue they close or address
  - Include testing evidence
  - Have at least one approval before merging
- Commit messages should explain *why*, not just *what*
- After merging, the branch is deleted

---

## Conflict Resolution

1. **Small disagreements (code style, naming):** Discuss in the PR comment thread. Majority vote or defer to the code reviewer.
2. **Larger disagreements (approach, design):** Bring to the team in a GitHub Issue or scheduled call. Discuss, document the decision, and move forward.
3. **Persistent issues:** Reach out to the instructor.

**Golden rule:** Assume good intent, focus on the idea (not the person), and aim for consensus.

## Meeting Cadence

- **Weekly standup:** [Day, time, format] — 15 minutes, quick status update
- **Ad-hoc pairing:** As needed for tricky problems
- **Code review:** Ongoing in PR comments
